# Game Messages & Sounds Manager
With this plugin you can easily replace the standard in-games messages like "Bomb Planted", "The target has been bombed", "Bomb Defused" etc. In addition, you can also replace the CT/T win sounds, sounds when planting/defusing the bomb, radio command sounds and so on.
